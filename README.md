# Silas Project
This is a statistical analysis of flight ticket prices. The analysis was created for my friend Silas and is used his master thesis. I analyzed price differences between different devices, websites and apps. I conducted a time series analysis and looked at relative price behaviour for 14 different flights with 7 unique destinations.
